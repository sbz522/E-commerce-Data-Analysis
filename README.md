# E-commerce-Data-Analysis

# Introduction:
This Capstone project is combination of SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. The project includes 2 main parts with subtasks inside:

  * Data Exploration and Analysis using SQL, Spreadsheets and Tableau
  * Presentation of my findings and insights.
I will work individually on the first project part and in a small team of 4 students on the second part of the project.

# Project Background:
The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.

Let's suppose that the Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 owners who are very invested in their business. They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly next few months. They see me as a candidate for DA position and provide me sample dataset from their sales data.

My task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost business growth.
